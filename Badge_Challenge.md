# Badge Challenge

In this challenge we needed to provide a company with some Badge options to control doors. This program allows you to create new badges, update doors for existing badges, delete all doors from an existing badge and show a list with all badge numbers and door access. This can all be done using a UI that the user can use to complete their tasks.
